									"TWICE are one of K-pop’s premier girl groups, denizens of the sunniest dance pop imaginable and also (possibly) a bellwether of the industry’s shifting priorities. Based in Seoul, the nine-member ensemble was created by JYP Entertainment in 2015 in the singing-competition television show <I>Sixteen</I>. That show revealed some of the pressures of K-pop training programs: Jihyo, TWICE’s leader (who joined JYP at age eight), was consistently told to lose weight on the show, and she confessed in a later documentary that she had often wanted to quit. But part of K-pop’s appeal has been its bright attitude, and TWICE toed that line easily when they debuted with the EP <I>The Story Begins</I> in late 2015. Subsequent releases continued to offer slices of relentlessly upbeat pop music, bolstered by their colorful outfits and bubbly energy. Their first LP, 2017’s <I>twicetagram</I>, topped many Asian charts, and, aided by having members who hail from Japan and Taiwan as well as Korea, they pushed into the Japanese market in 2018 with <I>BDZ</I>. They have serious songwriting firepower behind them, including MNEK, Zara Larsson, Justin Tranter, and Julia Michaels, who have written for the likes of Britney Spears, Selena Gomez, and Justin Bieber. But TWICE have endured some pain: In 2019, the dancer Mina took a break from performing, citing an anxiety disorder. JYP took the unprecedented step of announcing that diagnosis, and since that time, the group has become more outspoken about the importance of both physical and mental health—an unusual move in K-pop’s famously appearance-driven but intense industry. In 2020, they released the EP <I>MORE & MORE</I>, evincing a new sense of empowerment (“MAKE ME GO”) without sacrificing their enchanting playfulness.",

								artistBio:
									"Solána Rowe had a weird time growing up. Jersey suburbs, orthodox Muslim household, parents working their way through corporate America, wanted to fit in, couldn’t. She got bullied for wearing a hijab after 9/11 and became the kind of teenager who, on at least one occasion, drew the cops into a chase while joyriding in the family car. “[My parents] were only strict because they were reasonable,” she told Apple Music in 2017. “Like, they’re black, they come from the South and Midwest, they don’t come from anything…they’re not tryna take a gang of risks.” That Rowe had her own ideas about how to live didn’t help. “I rebelled really hard, and I learned everything the hard way,” she said. “I’m very hardheaded, very curious.” <br>\nIt’s a balance—rebellious but insecure, expressive but self-conscious, dreamy but alert—that has made Rowe resonant, but also an anomaly, the kind of artist who doesn’t ignore her quirks or contradictions, but brings them to the table in all their messy human glory. After self-releasing a couple of EPs in her early twenties (she took her name from the Nation of Islam’s Supreme Alphabet—Savior Zig-Zag Allah), she became the first female artist signed to Top Dawg Entertainment, joining future collaborators Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock. Released in 2017, her debut album, <I>Ctrl</I>, put her at the vanguard of contemporary R&B, mixing the expressivity of classic soul with a hazy, synth-heavy atmosphere and a playful sense of lyricism that brought Rowe’s inner monologue out. “Even with the heels and tighter clothes and other things, I’m still just me,” she said. “I still have a lot of anxiety about the world, and my thoughts, and what people think about my thoughts.”",

				artistBio:
					"In an interview with Apple Music, Kendrick Lamar reflected on his 2015 album <I>To Pimp a Butterfly</I>—in particular, the song “Alright.” It wasn’t that it sold well (it did). It wasn’t that it won awards (it did). It wasn’t even that it broke new ground for where hip-hop might go. For Lamar, the success was that people sang it in the streets. “A lot of people don’t have voices out there,” he said. “So to see them actually express themselves through song, through lyrics that I wrote?” For a kid from Compton whose life was transformed by hip-hop, the fame was nice, but the singing, the spirit, the possibility that his music was opening a cultural inroad for people joining the fight for civil rights—<I>that</I> was real. He might’ve been writing alone. But he was speaking for many.<br>\nBorn in 1987, Lamar grew up under the influence of JAY-Z, Eminem, and 2pac—for the wordplay, for the imagination, for the heart and sense of community. Given its popularity, Lamar’s music can be surprisingly dense, taking shape in winding, album-length narratives (<I>good kid, m.A.A.d city</I>), live-band hybrids of jazz and funk (<I>To Pimp a Butterfly</I>), and quasi-conceptual explorations of self (2017’s Pulitzer Prize-winning <I>DAMN.</I>). Yes, he wants greatness. But he wants it on his own terms. “I’m not doing it to have a good song,” he said. “Or one good rap. Or a good hook, or a good bridge. I want to keep doing it <I>every time</I>, period. And to do it every time you have to challenge yourself, and you have to confirm to yourself—not anybody else—that you’re the best.”",

										'In the two years since <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, we’ve hung on Kendrick Lamar\'s every word—whether he’s destroying rivals on a cameo, performing the #blacklivesmatter anthem <i>on top of a police car</i> at the BET Awards, or hanging out with Obama. So when <i>DAMN.</i> opens with a seemingly innocuous line—"So I was taking a walk the other day…”—we\'re all ears. The gunshot that abruptly ends the track is a signal: <i>DAMN.</i> is a grab-you-by-the-throat declaration that’s as blunt, complex, and unflinching as the name suggests. If <i>Butterfly</i> was jazz-inflected, soul-funk vibrance, <i>DAMN.</i> is visceral, spare, and straight to the point, whether he’s boasting about "royalty inside my DNA” on the trunk-rattling "DNA." or lamenting an anonymous, violent death on the soul-infused “FEAR.” No topic is too big to tackle, and the songs are as bold as their all-caps names: “PRIDE.” “LOYALTY.” “LOVE.” "LUST.” “GOD.” When he repeats the opening line to close the album, that simple walk has become a profound journey—further proof that no one commands the conversation like Kendrick Lamar.',

										"West Coast hip-hop elders like Snoop and Dre have virtually anointed Kendrick Lamar to carry on the legacy of gangsta rap. His second studio album <i>good kid, M.A.A.d city</i>, conceptual enough to be a rock opera, certainly uplifts the genre with its near-biblical themes: religion vs. violence and monogamy vs. lust. Verbally nimble, Lamar experiments with a variety of different lyrical styles, from the Bone Thugz-type of delivery on “Swimming Pools (Drank)” to the more straightforward orthodox G-funk flow on “m.A.A.d. City feat. MC Eiht.” Like prog rock, Lamar’s tracks have songs within songs—sudden tempo changes with alter egos and embedded interludes, such as unscripted recordings of his parents asking for their car back and neighborhood homies planning their latest conquest. These snippets pepper the album providing an anthropological glimpse into his life in Compton. The deluxe version of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> features five bonus tracks.",

								artistBio:
									"Raised on 2Pac, Biggie, Nas, and JAY-Z, J. Cole emerged in the 2010s as a kind of torchbearer for serious hip-hop. He takes on capital-T topics with an earnestness—and moral imperative—that most rappers seem to avoid. A North Carolina native (born in Frankfurt, West Germany, in 1985), Cole moved to New York City on scholarship to St. John’s University, graduating <I>magna cum laude</i> while making beats on the side, at one point waiting outside JAY-Z’s studio for three hours to give him a CD. Jay dismissed him initially, but circled back a year or so later on the strength of Cole’s mixtapes, making him the first signee to the Roc Nation label. Cole’s since gone on to release a string of ambitious, increasingly confident albums, often meditating on single subjects at length: 2018’s <i>KOD</i>, for example, offered a sustained look at addiction, while several songs on 2016’s <i>4 Your Eyez Only</i> were written from the perspective of a friend killed in his early twenties after leaving the drug game—a composite of people Cole knew from childhood. Despite the gravity of his subjects (and his sobering delivery), Cole—like his occasional collaborator Kendrick Lamar—is the rare artist who's managed to reconcile the conscious with the commercial, balancing his conceptual side with giant singles like “Work Out,” “Deja Vu,” and “ATM.” ",

									"Alongside Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, and the rest of the Top Dawg Entertainment crew, ScHoolboy Q has become one of the definitive voices of 2010s rap. A descendent of gangsta tradition, he can be rough (“Break the Bank”), he can be funny (“There He Go”), and he can be bracingly introspective (“Blessed”). But like Snoop Dogg before him, the underlying note in Q’s music is a kind of hard-won fun, the resilience of someone who knows darkness but keeps swaggering toward the light. “Many nights I cry,” he told Apple Music in 2019. “You know what I’m saying? That’s why I try to stay away from sad music at this point in my life. Like, even listening to sad music. I’m tryna smile, bro.” Carefree, no. But that doesn’t mean he can’t live.<br>\nBorn Quincy Matthew Hanley in 1986, on a military base in Wiesbaden, Germany, Q grew up in South Central LA, connecting with Top Dawg and forming the Black Hippy collective with Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, and Ab-Soul in the late 2000s. Though the feel was thoroughly West Coast, the influences skewed East: 50 Cent, Biggie, Nas. And while he never took a turn for the self-consciously serious (Q was serious from the beginning), he’s grown mellower and more self-assured with time, an avid golfer and proud dad who still knows how to turn up.",

								artistBio:
									'Dexterous Los Angeles rapper Jay Rock has proven his ability to persevere. Born Johnny Reed McKinzie Jr. 1985 and raised in the gang-riddled Nickerson Gardens housing project in the neighborhood of Watts, he got caught up in the streets himself before his talent and distinctively deep voice caught the attention of Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith. In 2005, Jay Rock became the first artist of Top Dawg Entertainment as Tiffith mentored him and a young Kendrick Lamar. As TDE evolved into an indie powerhouse with ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul\'s concurrent successes, the four rappers formed the supergroup Black Hippy; meanwhile, Jay dropped his 2011 debut album, <I>Follow Me Home</I>, on indie legend Tech N9ne\'s Strange Music. It was back to TDE for 2015\'s <I>90059</I>, an emotionally earnest LP that introduced him to new fans by expanding on his gruff, commanding street identity with cinematic storytelling, a wider range of production, and willingness to experiment with melody. But his momentum was jeopardized when a nearly fatal dirt bike accident in 2016 left him bruised both physically and mentally. He returned strong in 2018: He contributed to the TDE-helmed <I>Black Panther</I> soundtrack with "King\'s Dead" (featuring Kendrick, Future, and James Blake) and released his third album, <I>Redemption</I>, which reflects on his second chance at life (the single "Win" triumphantly celebrates his survival). Still, he wonders aloud if the accident was karma for his street sins, and he stirringly imagines his funeral. Fortunately for his fans, his TDE crew, and L.A. rap aficionados, Jay Rock survived––and he\'s unlikely to ever take his life, or his music, for granted.',

Still, the moment felt like a landmark, a measure of cultural influence that few rappers had attained. More than just a rapper, though, Rocky was a representation of a next-gen model of hip-hop, a post-internet artist who synthesized decades of rap history into a sound that was seamless, catchy, mainstream but with a sense of style that felt elevated. He was Gucci, he was street, he was New York without the burden of having to carry that New York torch. He made albums the way interior designers made rooms: unlikely juxtapositions, interesting connections. Everywhere he went, from Sotheby’s on down, it seemed like Rocky belonged.<br> \nBorn Rakim Mayers in 1988, Rocky fell in with the Harlem-based A$AP Mob in his late teens—a collective that, like Odd Future in Los Angeles, functioned as much like a creative agency as a rap crew, bringing a sense of self-sufficiency and independence to the mainstream machine. By the time he released his first full-length, 2013’s <I>LONG.LIVE.A$AP</I>, he’d already toured with Drake and performed at the Pitchfork Music Festival, straddling mainstream and indie without pulling a muscle. <I>AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP</I> came out in 2015, followed by <I>TESTING</I> in 2018, each moving progressively further away from pop without slipping on the charts.",

									"On the one hand, there's Donald Glover: the writer, actor, comedian, and director extraordinaire best known for his work on the sitcom <i>Community</i> and his original series (and homage to his hometown) <i>Atlanta</i>. Then there's Childish Gambino, the Grammy-winning multi-hyphenate musician and producer who's not as easy to describe—but that's also kind of the point. Shirking definition is key to his allure, a superpower of sorts that keeps onlookers entertained, intrigued, and altogether baffled in turns.<br>\nGlover was born in 1983, at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California, but Childish Gambino came into existence, famously, with the aid of an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator, sometime around 2008, when he decided to use the moniker so that fans of his comedy wouldn’t think his music was just a bit. While not exactly the kind of backstory many rappers and singers would readily admit to, it's a fitting place to start in order to understand his idiosyncratic approach to music, which manages to strike a delicate balance between artful and whimsical. Glover's first recordings—which he once said sounded like a “decrepit” version of Drake—predate the name change and never formally saw the light of day. But Childish Gambino's earliest mixtapes, from the late 2000s, are the reflections of a cultural sponge who simply desired to create on his own terms. Ever since, genre descriptors have grown increasingly useless—he shrewdly treats genre like more of a suggestion than a limitation—but terms like hip-hop, R&B, funk, and indie electro-pop, all pushed to their experimental bounds, are good jumping-off points. Some of Gambino's biggest hits, from the nimble display of \"3005\" and psychedelic soul of \"Redbone\" to the blistering raps of \"This Is America,\" share little in common aesthetically, yet he executes each with aplomb. Some catalogs are emblems of polished order and cohesion, but his is a rabbit hole of tangled genius and surprises well worth falling into.",

									"“I feel responsible to speak for people who don’t have a voice,” Joey Bada$$ told Apple Music in 2017, and the Brooklyn rapper’s music reflects this commitment. Born Jo-Vaughn Scott in 1995, Bada$$ has been repping his borough and New York City forefathers like Nas and Big L since he released his 2012 mixtape <I>1999</I> when he was just 17. Thanks to his bottomless reservoir of issues-minded lyricism over boom-bap beats (“Survival Tactics”) and joyful Native Tongues-style flowing (“Waves”), it became an instant classic in hip-hop circles. By 2015’s <I>B4.Da.$$</I>, his political perspective had broadened, as he tackled greed (“Paper Trail$,” which nods to Wu-Tang Clan) and the struggle to stay hopeful in a world that wants to see you fail (“Like Me”). And he’s done it all while remaining independent, thanks to the growth of the collective he co-founded, Pro Era, an assemblage of rappers and producers who grew up together in Brooklyn and whose projects include their own record label and clothing line. Over time, Joey’s music has expanded in style and production—for instance, 2017’s “Devastated” contains elements of trap and a rock-inflected shouted hook—but his focus on sophisticated narratives about life as a black man in America and giving voice to the voiceless isn’t changing one bit.",

								artistBio:
									"A year or so after <I>Thank Me Later</I> hit, Drake was browsing art in L.A. when a neon sign caught his eye: “LESS DRAKE, MORE TUPAC.” At first he felt like ripping it off the wall. Instead, he bought it. After all, he figured if someone puts your name next to Tupac, you must be doing something right, even if they’re trying to take you down.  \n\nBorn Aubrey Drake Graham in Toronto in 1986, he—like Tupac—became the voice of a generation and prism for his pop-cultural moment. Was he an R&B singer who rapped or a rapper who sang? Was he really that sad, or just exploiting a cultural preference for male vulnerability? From the jump, he let his contradictions define him: Tender, but cruel; sober one minute and drunk-dialing the next; a guy who could convince you he was an underdog from his perch on top of the world. \n\nLurid as his inner world is, the proof lies in his reach outward. A Drake project can incorporate house and club music (2022’s <I>Honestly, Nevermind</I>; 2017’s <I>More Life</I>) and red-eyed trap (2022’s 21 Savage collab <I>Her Loss</I>) with equal conviction and at no loss to the subjectivity at the center. “I obviously spend a lot of time in my own world,” he told Apple Music. “But when I do take a look at the broader scope of things… I've always tried to make music that transcends gender, nationality—to try and unify people. Because that’s really what it’s about.”",

									"Travis Scott has helped define the sound and feel of 2010s rap, imbuing tough, surrealistic trap with a distinctly pop appeal. Raised in the suburbs of Houston, Scott (born Jacques Berman Webster II in 1992) first made noise as an in-house producer for Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music, working on the 2012 label showcase <i>Cruel Summer</i> and 2013’s <i>Yeezus</i>, which arrived mere weeks after he dropped his debut mixtape, <i>Owl Pharaoh</i>. He went on to bring his gothic-edged sound to Drake, Migos, Madonna, and Rihanna (“Bitch Better Have My Money”), while his own solo albums—2015’s <i>Rodeo</i> and 2016’s <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</i>—playfully drew the commercial center of rap toward the avant-garde. Take 2018’s <i>ASTROWORLD</i>, a swirling, almost psychedelic set that not only managed to pull together Quavo, John Mayer, Tame Impala, and Sheck Wes on the same album, but also had them gel—a testament to Scott’s vision as an artist and superlative curator.",

								artistBio:
									"When Tyler, The Creator first started gaining national notoriety around 2008, it would’ve been easy to dismiss him as cheap shock—a snotty kid willing to push every button (mass murder, rape, cannibalism) just to get a little attention. Within a few years, he’d evolved into one of hip-hop’s genuine polymaths, a self-contained brand who not only rapped, wrote, produced, and art-directed, but designed clothes and created television shows; whose vision—violent, surreal, sarcastic, and disarmingly introspective—captured the id of an audience who didn’t know how to relate to their feelings but weren’t going to keep them in any longer.<br>\nRaised in Los Angeles County, Tyler (born Tyler Okonma in 1991) started experimenting with music in his early teens, co-founding the Odd Future collective in 2007, a group whose members included fellow iconoclasts Earl Sweatshirt, Frank Ocean, and Syd Tha Kyd. Influenced by the grab-bag eclecticism of Pharrell Williams and his own tirelessly messed-up inner monologues, his official debut, <i>Goblin</i>, came out in 2011. (“Wow, life’s a cute b***h full of estrogen,” he rapped on the title track. “And when she gives you lemons, n***a, throw ’em at pedestrians.”) Gritty, nightmarish, and barbed, the album established him as a kind of antihero: an artist whose bad reputation only made his fans love him more. <i>Wolf</i> (2013) and <i>Cherry Bomb</i> (2015) explored similar psychological territory with increasing nuance; his productions got more sophisticated too, exploring soul-jazz (“FIND YOUR WINGS”), Latin music (“Tamale”), and ’90s R&B (“Awkward”) in ways that were both discordant and colorful, a full rainbow of bad feeling.<br>\nIn 2017, he released <i>Flower Boy</i>, an album whose vulnerability and eclecticism represented a major step up—a maturation from young punk to complex young man. It ended up being nominated for a Grammy. Meanwhile, he’d found the time to create not one but three television shows (<i>Loiter Squad</i>, <i>Nuts + Bolts</i>, <i>The Jellies</i>), launch a vibrant streetwear line (Golf Wang), and spearhead an annual festival called the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. Like Kanye and Pharrell before him, and artists like the BROCKHAMPTON collective after, Tyler represents a new chapter in hip-hop, toying with identity and sexuality, and drawing on influences—skate culture, therapy speak, the kaleidoscopic weirdness of life on the internet—that help to expand rap’s vocabulary while still keeping continuity with the past. In 2019, he released <i>IGOR</i>, his most mood-driven, soul-baring work to date.",

										"When Kendrick Lamar popped up on two tracks from Baby Keem’s <i>The Melodic Blue</i> (“range brothers” and “family ties”), it felt like one of hip-hop’s prophets had descended a mountain to deliver scripture. His verses were stellar, to be sure, but it also just felt like way too much time had passed since we’d heard his voice. He’d helmed 2018’s <i>Black Panther</i> compilation/soundtrack, but his last proper release was 2017’s <i>DAMN.</i> That kind of scarcity in hip-hop can only serve to deify an artist as beloved as Lamar. But if the Compton MC is broadcasting anything across his fifth proper album <i>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers</i>, it’s that he’s only human.\n\nThe project is split into two parts, each comprising nine songs, all of which serve to illuminate Lamar’s continually evolving worldview. Central to Lamar’s thesis is accountability. The MC has painstakingly itemized his shortcomings, assessing his relationships with money (“United in Grief”), white women (“Worldwide Steppers”), his father (“Father Time”), the limits of his loyalty (“Rich Spirit”), love in the context of heteronormative relationships (“We Cry Together,” “Purple Hearts”), motivation (“Count Me Out”), responsibility (“Crown”), gender (“Auntie Diaries”), and generational trauma (“Mother I Sober”). It’s a dense and heavy listen. But just as sure as Kendrick Lamar is human like the rest of us, he’s also a Pulitzer Prize winner, one of the most thoughtful MCs alive, and someone whose honesty across <i>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers</i> could help us understand why any of us are the way we are.",

										'In the two years since <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, we’ve hung on Kendrick Lamar\'s every word—whether he’s destroying rivals on a cameo, performing the #blacklivesmatter anthem <i>on top of a police car</i> at the BET Awards, or hanging out with Obama. So when <i>DAMN.</i> opens with a seemingly innocuous line—"So I was taking a walk the other day…”—we\'re all ears. The gunshot that abruptly ends the track is a signal: <i>DAMN.</i> is a grab-you-by-the-throat declaration that’s as blunt, complex, and unflinching as the name suggests. If <i>Butterfly</i> was jazz-inflected, soul-funk vibrance, <i>DAMN.</i> is visceral, spare, and straight to the point, whether he’s boasting about "royalty inside my DNA” on the trunk-rattling "DNA." or lamenting an anonymous, violent death on the soul-infused “FEAR.” No topic is too big to tackle, and the songs are as bold as their all-caps names: “PRIDE.” “LOYALTY.” “LOVE.” "LUST.” “GOD.” When he repeats the opening line to close the album, that simple walk has become a profound journey—further proof that no one commands the conversation like Kendrick Lamar.',

										"West Coast hip-hop elders like Snoop and Dre have virtually anointed Kendrick Lamar to carry on the legacy of gangsta rap. His second studio album <i>good kid, M.A.A.d city</i>, conceptual enough to be a rock opera, certainly uplifts the genre with its near-biblical themes: religion vs. violence and monogamy vs. lust. Verbally nimble, Lamar experiments with a variety of different lyrical styles, from the Bone Thugz-type of delivery on “Swimming Pools (Drank)” to the more straightforward orthodox G-funk flow on “m.A.A.d. City feat. MC Eiht.” Like prog rock, Lamar’s tracks have songs within songs—sudden tempo changes with alter egos and embedded interludes, such as unscripted recordings of his parents asking for their car back and neighborhood homies planning their latest conquest. These snippets pepper the album providing an anthropological glimpse into his life in Compton. The deluxe version of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> features five bonus tracks.",

										"The rapper formerly known as K-Dot had built a buzz prior to his 2011 breakthrough album, but the Compton native still had everything to prove: In spite of a coveted co-sign from Dr. Dre, he was barely out of the shadow of his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmate Jay Rock, on whose tour Lamar still regularly served as hype-man. Los Angeles’ old guard of gangsta rap greats was waning; the hottest trend in L.A. rap around the time Lamar was forming his Black Hippy super-group (alongside Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q) was the jerkin’ movement, a fun but frivolous dance craze. Los Angeles hip-hop needed a new hero, and Lamar stepped up to the plate. <br />\nBut <i>Section.80</i> was far from a bid for mainstream attention. Over jazzy beats suited for contemplative spells, Lamar raps like he’s searching, bar by bar, for answers to America’s biggest questions, turning a critical eye on his own reality and the systems that reinforce it. The title itself combines Section 8 housing, the low-income developments in which Lamar was raised, with the decade of Lamar’s birth; he thus fashioned himself an ambassador for a generation raised under Ronald Reagan and the crack epidemic. “You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the ’80s,” Lamar spits on lead single “A.D.H.D.,” a generational study as sharp as it is catchy. Ultimately, though, <i>Section.80</i> channels that unrest into a quest for enlightenment; on the knocking “HiiiPower,” Lamar conjures visions of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. and urges listeners to “build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs.” Upon the album's release, some listeners thought this stuff was too radical for Lamar to ever fully break into the mainstream; but the maverick was on the threshold of something even bigger.",
